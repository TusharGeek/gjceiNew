              The outreach activity is an important part of the incubation
              center's business model. Through outreach activity, people can
              come to learn more about the company's products and services. It
              also serves as an incubation centre for new ideas that need more
              time to develop. The main goal of outreach activity is to increase
              exposure and awareness for a product or service. It can be done
              through social media posts, email marketing and other forms of
              advertising. GJCEI is indulge with various outreach activities to
              reach school students, teachers, college students to increase the

              to promote our incubation centre. Also, we welcome our visitors
              with whole heartedly. Any school, college, university can visit us
